CTI Models
diamond model, cyber killchain

MITRE mitigation starts identify the T code to go with the scenario (what t code directly adhears to the situation) 2 will be close which one is closer

APT Known IOC : IOC's are already parsed observable text file already provided take a look at system overview and see if there are instances of comprimises

Traffic Flows: Will say you have traffic going from two different subnets what will the ingress and egress be of the packets? Where does it have to ingress and then egresss (ingress form switch to the router egress from the router to destination subnet/switch)

PRACTICAL

Recognize suricata Error 

Nfdump: Utilize 
cli= nfdump -r netflow_1  -I

ROuter SPAn config: 

shrun 

tdpdump -r (oldfile.pcap) -Y "display filter" -w (newfile)           THEN shasum -a 256 newfile

ALWAYS SAVE FILE AS RAW
