The Risk Equation
  After determining impact and probability of the threats compiled in Phase 1 of the ACF, determining risk (or risk weight) is a simple equation, as follows:

  Impact (I) × Probability (P) = Risk (R)

  For example, if a threat has an impact rating of 4 and a probability rating of 3, the risk weight is 12 (4 × 3 = 12). A good rule of thumb for classifying threats is:
  0 to 9: Low risk
  10 to 16: Medium risk
  17 to 25: High risk
  Given the natural subjectivity of these numbers, it is important that all the initial figures are determined by the same person or committee for uniformity and consistency. 
  One person might determine a risk weight of 20 when another might determine a risk weight of 10 for the same threat. Having added variance in subjective numbers is something to be avoided.

  Module 3’s Key Terrain in Cyberspace (KT-C) lesson discussed tier levels for assets on a network, where Tier 1 is the most critical and Tier 3 is the least critical. 
  Risk weight classification is a related concept, but instead of classifying terrain, it classifies actions against the terrain.
