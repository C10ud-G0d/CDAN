Applying Display Filters To TShark

An interface can be captured by using -i. An example is as follows: 
tshark -i eth0 

A display filter can be added by using -Y. An example is as follows: 
tshark -Y tcp 

The two commands above can be combined as the following:
tshark -i eth0 -Y tcp 

Run the following command to create a new PCAP file named maliciousip443.pcap. The applied display filter limits the new file to only TCP port 443 traffic to or from the IP address 202.84.73.91:
$ tshark -r fullday.pcap -w maliciousip443.pcap -Y "ip.addr == 202.84.73.91 and tcp.port == 443"

In the above TShark command, the following (case-sensitive) parameters are used:
-r: The file to be read, ensuring that TShark acts on a file rather than capturing from an interface.
-w: Redirect output to a file rather than displaying output to the terminal.
-Y: The display filter to be used.

When executed correctly, the above command has no output to the terminal.

To quickly analyze statistics of the newly created PCAP file, use the capinfos utility to display a general overview of the file characteristics. Run the following command:
  capinfos maliciousip443.pcap

In the Terminal window, run the following command to create a targeted PCAP file containing only traffic from the suspicious IP address above:
$ tshark -r sensoroni_onion-fn2_1023.pcap -Y "ip.addr == 104.53.222.103" -w exported_objects/evidence_1.pcap

AP file from sensor 1 containing traffic from the originally discovered infected host, run the following command to create a new file containing only traffic to or from 172.16.4.2:
$ tshark -r sensoroni_onion-fn1_1024.pcap -Y "ip.addr == 172.16.4.2" -w exported_objects/evidence_2.pcap
